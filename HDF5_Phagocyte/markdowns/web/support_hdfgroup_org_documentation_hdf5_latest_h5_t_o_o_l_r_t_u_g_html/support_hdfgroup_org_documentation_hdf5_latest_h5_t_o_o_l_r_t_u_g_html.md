#  h5repart
##  Introduction
With h5repart, you can repartition a file family. This program can be used to split a single file into a family of files, join a family of files into a single file, or copy one family to another while changing the size of the family members. It can also be used to copy a single file to a single file with holes.
##  Usage
#### h5repart [OPTIONS] SRC DST
##  SRC/DST
  * **SRC** The name of the source file 
  * **DST** The name of the destination files


##  Options
  * **-v** Produce verbose output 
  * **-V** Print version number and exit 
  * **-b N** The I/O block size, defaults to 1kB 
  * **-m N** The destination member size or 1GB 
  * **-family_to_sec2** Deprecated version of -family_to_single (below) 
  * **-family_to_single** Change file driver from family to the default single-file VFD (windows or sec2)


Sizes may be suffixed with 'g' for GB, 'm' for MB or 'k' for kB. File family names include an integer printf format such as '%d'
