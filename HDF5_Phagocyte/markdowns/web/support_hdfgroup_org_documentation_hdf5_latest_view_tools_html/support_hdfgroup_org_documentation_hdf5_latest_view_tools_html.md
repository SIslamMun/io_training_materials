#  Basic Facts about HDF5
The following are basic facts about HDF5 files to keep in mind while completing these tutorial topics: 
  * All HDF5 files contain a root group "/". 
  * There are two primary objects in HDF5, a group and a dataset:  
Groups allow objects to be organized into a group structure, such as a tree.  
Datasets contain raw data values. 
  * Additional information about an HDF5 object may optionally be stored in attributes attached to the object.
