Java Array Conversion
This is a class for handling multidimensional arrays for HDF. 
The purpose is to allow the storage and retrieval of arbitrary array types containing scientific data. 
The methods support the conversion of an array to and from Java to a one-dimensional array of bytes suitable for I/O by the C library. 
This class heavily uses the [Native Arrays of Numbers](https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/_h_d_f_n_a_t_i_v_e.html) class to convert between Java and C representations.
