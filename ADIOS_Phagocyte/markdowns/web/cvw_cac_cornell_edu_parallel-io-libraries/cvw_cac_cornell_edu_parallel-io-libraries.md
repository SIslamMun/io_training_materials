## Roadmap: Parallel I/O Libraries
  

##### Topics
[1. Structured Data](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel-io-libraries/structured-data/index)[2. PnetCDF](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel-io-libraries/pnetcdf/index)[3. PHDF5](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel-io-libraries/phdf5/index)[4. ADIOS](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel-io-libraries/adios/index)
Many scientific applications work with structured data, and in many cases such data require pre- and post-processing. I/O libraries exist that not only allow applications to work with portable, self-describing file formats, but also provide tools to process the data. In this roadmap, we introduce parallel I/O libraries and techniques that can be used to increase the throughput and efficiency of I/O bound applications. Efficient parallel I/O becomes extremely important as we scale scientific applications across large numbers of nodes comprised of multiple cores and accelerators. 
##### Objectives
After you complete this roadmap, you should be able to:
  * Summarize the motivation for using I/O libraries like netCDF and HDF5, as well as their parallel counterparts PnetCDF and PHDF5.
  * Describe the basic use of the PnetCDF and PHDF5 APIs, as well as the rationale for the ADIOS API.
  * Use a high level I/O library with parallel code.


##### Prerequisites
  * A working knowledge of general programming concepts
  * Ability to program in a high-level language such as [Fortran](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/fortran-intro), [C](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/cintro), or C++
  * A basic familiarity with [parallel programming concepts](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel/)
  * A basic familiarity with [parallel I/O concepts](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel-io/)


##### Requirements
The examples and exercises in this roadmap are designed to run on [Frontera](https://tacc.utexas.edu/systems/frontera/) or [Stampede3](https://tacc.utexas.edu/systems/stampede3/). To use these systems, you need: 
  * A TACC account to login to Frontera or Stampede3
  * A compute time allocation for Frontera or Stampede3
