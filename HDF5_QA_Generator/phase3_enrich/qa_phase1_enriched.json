    "answer": "To enhance I/O performance in the asynchronous I/O framework, an optimization is proposed that merges multiple compatible write operations. This approach consolidates these operations into fewer, contiguous write requests. The rationale is that performing a single large write operation, or a small number of them, is significantly faster than executing the same data transfer through numerous smaller, individual write operations.",
