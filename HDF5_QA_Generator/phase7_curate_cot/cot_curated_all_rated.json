    "question": "What must applications ensure when using async writes?",
    "reasoning": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1.  Asynchronous writes mean the application continues executing without waiting for the write operation to complete. This introduces the risk of modifying the data buffer before it's written.\n2.  If the buffer is modified prematurely, the write operation will use the modified data, leading to data corruption or incorrect results.\n3.  Therefore, applications must ensure the buffer's integrity during the write operation. A common technique to achieve this is double buffering, where a copy of the data is made for the asynchronous write.",

Therefore, applications must ensure the buffer's integrity during the write operation. A common technique to achieve this is double buffering, where a copy of the data is made for the asynchronous write.\n\nwhen employing asynchronous writes, applications have a crucial responsibility:\n\n*   **Buffer Integrity:** Applications must guarantee that the memory buffers designated for asynchronous write operations remain unaltered until the write operation is entirely finalized. This is essential to prevent data corruption or unpredictable behavior.\n\n*   **Double Buffering (Often Required):** To achieve this buffer integrity, a common technique is to use double buffering. This involves creating a separate, independent copy of the data to be written. The asynchronous write operation then uses this copy, allowing the original buffer to be modified without affecting the ongoing write process.",
